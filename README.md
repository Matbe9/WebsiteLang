### Readme languages
* [English](https://github.com/NeronApp/WebsiteLang/blob/main/README.md)
* [Français](https://github.com/NeronApp/WebsiteLang/blob/main/READMEFR.md)

This repository contains all translation files for www.neronapp.com website.
<br>
You can contribute by adding new languages or by improving existing translations.

### How it works

All translation files are located in the **translations** folder and are in standard YAML format.
<br>
They are named with the code name of their country (fr=France, en=England) followed by the extension yml.
<br>
Each language is filled in the **global.yml** file with its name and the text displayed for the language change.
<br>
<br>
If you want to add a language, contact us beforehand on our [Discord server](https://discord.neronapp.com).
